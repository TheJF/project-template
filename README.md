# Project Template

This serves as a quick template to start Grunt projects from. At the time of writing WebPack wasn't really a thing, so this will likely get deprecated for that.

## Usage

`npm i` to install packages

`grunt` to start the server with the watch

`http://localhost:4000` in your browser to view it
